# tweet-fetch
Node.js web-app that fetches tweets on a real time basis using Socket.io.
HTML, CSS and JS was used for the front end.

**If you want to run it locally:**
1. Clone the github repository onto your system using `git clone https://github.com/nileshnj993/tweet-fetch.git`
2. Create a [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access) account and obtain your Twitter bearer token. Add this to a .env file in your source directory and name it `TWITTER_BEARER_TOKEN`
3. Navigate to the directory on your code editor and use `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
4. Use `npm run start` or `npm run dev` in order to start the server.
5. You can now access it on http://localhost:8000/
